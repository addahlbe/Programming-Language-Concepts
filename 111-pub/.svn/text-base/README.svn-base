To compile gratr, go to the gratr subdirectory, and run either

-- make, if you are on Mac or Linux
-- compile, if you are on Windows (do this from the cmd shell, in
   that directory)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
To run gratr on Windows, copy gratr to the directory where you want to
run it (on mini1.gr, say), and then do the following from the cmd
shell:

gratr --lang-only mini1.gr

This will generate GraphViz files (see below).

To run the automaton on the sequence of characters in a test file
called q1.txt, do

gratr --run q1.txt --lang-only mini1.gr

On Mac/Linux, this is similar, except you can just use gratr (generated
by make), and you might need to call

./gratr

instead of 

gratr

----------------------------------------------------------------------
You can process GraphViz files to generate nice-looking renditions
of automata.  To run dot on min.gv to create a min.jpg:

dot -Tjpeg -o min.jpg min.gv

(On Windows you would do this in the cmd shell, or on Linux/Mac from a
terminal.)
